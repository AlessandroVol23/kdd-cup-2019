# Task 2 Ideas

## Task Description

Task 2 in Baidu describes:

_The published dataset has great potential to be applied in various research tasks and applications. The second task will be an open challenge based on the published dataset. A research/application proposal is required to explain:_
1) The proposed research/application topic, including the aim of the research/application, the context and the justification.
2) The general methodology and expected resources and conditions to complete the research/application. A demo/video to help explain the final output is encouraged to submit.
3) The importance of your research/application topic.

## Ideas (sorted by priorities)

__1. Demand prediction with time-series forecasting methods__

We want to predict either the demand of the whole app or the demand of each transport mode. With this we can make suggestions for the usage of public transportation or car usages, etc.

__2. Temporal-Spatial visual analysis__

The idea is to have an interactive dashboard with all traffic flows either from raw points or from different cluster. The aim here is ot have an overview of the user's behaviour at different times and places.

__3. Cluster NaN Pids:__

We have a lot of Pids which don't have an entry. We want to cluster these Pids based on the other features like time and place. 

__4. Weak spots__

Find weak spots in infrastructure or public transportation based on e.g. ratio of distance and distance on plans. If the normal distance is just one km and the distance in the plans is about 10 kms it is a bad connection and could be improved. 

__5. Time Price Distance of CO2 neutral Transport modes__

Every transport mode has co2 emission. We want to figure out which have the least amounts and find factors which influence them.
